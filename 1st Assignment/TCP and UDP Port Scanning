TCP AND UDP PORT DISCOVERY
INTRODUCTION:
TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It lies between the Application and Network layers and helps in the communication between different devices over a network. It is used in services that require safety, like military sites or email.
UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. It is a connectionless method of data transfer between devices in a network. It is typically used in video games, video and music streaming.

DIFFERENCES:
                                              TCP	                                       UDP
                1. Connection-oriented. The two devices first establish               1. Connectionless. The data packets are directly 
                a connection between them and then transmit data.	                     sent between receiving devices.                            
                2. Reliability is ensured as a connection is made before              2. No reliability as there is no prior connection,
                data is sent.                                                          which means the delivery of data cannot be guaranteed.
                3. TCP has extensive error checking mechanisms.                       3. UDP has only basic error checking mechanisms using checksums.
	              4. TCP is slower as an initial connection has to be made.             4. UDP is faster as there is no need for a connection to be made.
	              5. Uses handshakes like SYN/ACK.                                      5. No handshakes as it is connectionless.
	

TCP Scanning:  
The previous screenshot is the result of TCP port scanning. It shows that 4 out of 1000 common TCP ports are open. Two of these ports are standard SSH and HTTP services, while the other two are test ports.
Code: nmap -sT scanme.nmap.org


UDP Scanning:
 
The above screenshot displays the result of UDP port scanning. Port 123/udp is up and running NTP, which is a program to sync system clocks. The other 9 ports are all open|filtered, indicating firewalled responses.
Code: sudo -sU â€“top ports 10 scanme.nmap.org
